           <h3>About us</h3>
<p>News Now; A News outlet made by an ambitious team of reporters who strived to bring the truth to the public; They started out as a reporter group who reported the reports in the news paper of reports, this news paper based in Puerto Rico, 1964. In 1964, our news paper was named "Recibe tus noticias ahora", later in the years 2000s, our news paper not only changed its name to what we know and love "News Now" but we also began to digitalize the way we publicized our news to the public through out digital media and slowly vanished the use of paper in our business; therefore becoming completly enviorment friendly. In the year 2016 our company was bought by Jeffrey Bezos, where we got the oppurtunity to work together and improve our web with Jeff, who is also a very nice person (trust me). We also added our subscription feature in which our lovable viewers can get notified when a new article is published and also support our page through any payment method you prefer. </p>

           <h3>What is Politics and economy?</h3>
<p> Politics (from Greek: Πολιτικά, politiká, 'affairs of the cities') is the set of activities that are associated with making decisions in groups, or other forms of power relations among individuals, such as the distribution of resources or status. An economy (from Ancient Greek οἰκονομία (oikonomía) 'management of a household, administration'; from οἶκος (oîkos) 'household', and νέμω (némō) 'distribute, allocate') is an area of the production, distribution and trade, as well as consumption of goods and services by different agents. In practice there is a strong relationship between economics and politics because the performance of the economy is one of the key political battlegrounds. Many economic issues are inherently political because they lend themselves to different opinions. Both of these topics affecting our society and reminding us that we do reside in one; Jaden was clearly being affected by this and dying to shed light on it. </p>
      <h2>In the year 2022 the famous Jaden Christopher Syre Smith offered us a great piece of his philosophy, after receiving feedback on his literature this is what Mr. Smith had to say.</h2>
